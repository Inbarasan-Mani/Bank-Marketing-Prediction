##### Aim: 

This Dataset is contains of information about the customers whom having account in a client's bank. For Targetting a new product we segregate our customers based on their current subscription. 

From the Information about the Current Subscription who are all the target customer to reach, by the correct approach the client can earn better profit by selling the new upcoming product.



##### Solution: 

To Solve this Problem I'll use a colaborative apporach of Classification.

Here I thought of Using Clustering Based Classification, whereas Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning (i.e.,) it won't have target variable, but in this dataset I have a Target variable called 'Subscription'. If I do Clustering, it probably may ended up into two classes of 0 or 1 (i.e.,) Either the Final customer is Subscribed or Not Subscribed.



##### Working Procedure:

* Classifiying Data, Once I get accurate Classification of Data.
